# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
MIS-546 Project Portfolio 

### Introduction
COVID-19, a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus, has profoundly impacted the world through widespread illness, economic disruption, social upheaval, and highlighted systemic vulnerabilities in our world. It had an immense impact on the mental and physical health on people due to death, sickness, job layoffs, lockdowns, and limitations on daily activities.  

Twitter (now known as X) is a social media platform where users can post and interact with short messages known as tweets. Twitter allows users to express their opinions and concerns in text form. Due to people staying indoors more, there was a surge in social media usage. Due to this phenomenon, data scientists can collect structural data from Twitter. Whereas other platforms such as Instagram/TikTok provide us with unstructured data. Therefore, data scientists can use text analytics, sentiment analysis, and natural language processing to analyze tweets by the public and find insights in them.  

Traditional sentiment analysis, commonly used in the industry, often struggles to capture the subtleties and context embedded in social media language. For instance, a simple positive/negative categorization may overlook the complexities of sentiments expressed during a global crisis, leading to an incomplete understanding. Among all the social media, Twitter is the best data collection option. Additionally, users on Twitter are more likely to express more of their emotions than other social media where they are more likely to filter their expression, such as only expressing happy emotions. 

### Dataset
We are using OPENICOSR data set: COVID-19 Twitter Dataset with Latent Topics, Sentiments and Emotions Attributes. This is a large global dataset on people’s discourse and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic over the Twitter platform in the world. The dataset analyzed tweets with the words “corona”, “Wuhan”, “nCov” and “covid”. The dataset contains COVID-19 related tweets, analyzed for topics, sentiments, and emotions, useful for various interdisciplinary studies. The dataset that we have is already pre-processed by analyzing tweets. We will clean the dataset and perform data wrangling by extracting more features from the data available. 

### Visuals
In terms of visuals, we first wanted to visualize some basic information related to the dataset:
